·       The “View case gallery” button is significantly smaller than in the Creative version

·       There is too much background confetti, it obscures the text. There should be no confetti under/behind the text and button

·       There is no white line separating line between the grey and pink backgrounds (see image)

·       The pink background/the pink box is too small (see image)

·       The confetti should extend beyond the pink background, but it does not (see image)

·       There is no border around the slider image (see image)

·       The links just link back the main/home page (not sure if this is because pages aren’t created yet, but just thought I’d mention it)

·       The size of the “View patient stories” button is significantly smaller than the Creative version

·       The “View patient stories” button link does not work. It should link to the Patient success stories marketing page

·       The patient success stories “Smiles for Miles” and “@DogsandKeto” both have half the border as a grey shadow, the last one “HappyFace” doesn’t. I think we should keep it consistent for all (I prefer the all-white border)

·       The ClearCorrect logo for “Smiles for Miles” is stretched. The logos for all are kind of blurry. It should be set up so that the logo remains with the correct dimensions always and would be great if it was as clear as in the Creative version

·       The text for the “Doctors, ….” Sentence spacing is off. It should have “Doctors,” on one line and the rest of the text underneath (see image)

·       The “View case gallery” button is significantly smaller than the creative version

·       The “Sign up today” link, links back to the main page (again not sure if this is because the page hasn’t been created yet, but mentioning it regardless)

·       The iPad image seems blurry/less clear than in the Creative version (not sure if this is just me)",,Jamila Jones,,5ec2c2e15ba5dc0c1c590f8a,,,,,,,,,,,22/Jan/21 10:44 AM;ug:222dce99-265d-4237-85cd-11d22a742100;Home_Main Marketing Page .docx;https://clearcorrect-creativecircle.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10015/Home_Main+Marketing+Page+.docx,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,0|i00009:zzzzzzzzzb,,,,,,,,,,,,,To Do
